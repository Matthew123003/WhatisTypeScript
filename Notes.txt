The JavaScript code you provided is the compiled version of your TypeScript code. It uses JavaScript constructs 
such as Promise and generator functions to handle asynchronous operations using the __awaiter function. This function
 is used to translate the async and await syntax from TypeScript to an equivalent structure in JavaScript that works 
 in older JavaScript environments.

Here's what the compiled JavaScript code does:

Imports: It starts by importing the stylesheets (require("./style.css");) just like in your TypeScript code.

Form Selection: It selects the form element with the ID #defineform.

Form Submission: An event listener is added to the form's onsubmit event, which triggers an asynchronous function 
(__awaiter) when the form is submitted.

Event Handling: In the async function, event.preventDefault() is called to prevent the default form submission, 
and the code retrieves the form data and the word to define.

Fetch API: The code uses the Fetch API to get data from the dictionary API for the entered word and then processes 
the JSON response.

Definition Extraction: It extracts the definition from the response data using optional chaining (?.) and provides 
a default message ('Definition not found.') in case the definition is not found.

Definition Display: If the definition element exists in the HTML document, the code updates its innerText with the 
retrieved definition.

Error Handling: If an error occurs while fetching the data, it logs the error to the console.

The compiled JavaScript code should work in modern JavaScript environments, as it uses features like Promise and the 
Fetch API. To use this JavaScript file in your HTML file, make sure to include it in a <script> tag in the HTML file. 
For example:

html
Copy code
<script src="path/to/your/compiled/javascript/file.js"></script>

Replace "path/to/your/compiled/javascript/file.js" with the correct path to the JavaScript file in your project.
 Make sure the script tag is placed in your HTML file so that it executes after the HTML elements are loaded. 
 Typically, this script tag would be placed at the bottom of the body section.

 //Also dont know why the doctype has to be not HTML either

 // Import stylesheets
import './style.css';
const form = document.querySelector('#defineform') as HTMLFormElement;
form.onsubmit = async (event: Event) => {
  event.preventDefault();
  const formData = new FormData(form);
  const word: string = formData.get('defineword') as string;
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/${word}`);
    const data = await response.json();
    const definition: string = data[0]?.meanings[0]?.definitions[0]?.definition || 'Definition not found.';
    const definitionElement = document.getElementById('definition');
    if (definitionElement) {
      definitionElement.innerText = definition;
    } else {
      console.error('Element with id "definition" not found');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error fetching data:', error);
  }
};
